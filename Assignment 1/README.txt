Assignment 1 Computer Vision
COMP 6341

How to Run:
I have used PyCharm IDE to develop my assignment.
There is only one file named Assignment1.py and in main method I have used the images Pencils.jpg and pencils_mosaic.bmp
You can run another images by placing it at line 81 and 82 in main method.

Result:
In Result 2 images will be generated (First It'll generate result of Part 1 and then when pressing enter it'll display result of part 2).
In both images, there is a stack of 3 images(Original, demosaic, difference) as displayed in assignment description.

I have also attached one more file in which I explained the result of both parts and the question being asked in Assignment description. Please go through it.
